took input.
Now i should create a thread for each philosopher. (array of threads)
as well as an array of forks that hold the status for each index (0,1 -> free,used)
And Mutexes to protect each fork.

int forks => mutex ;
Start a simulation loop (only stops if a philo dies)
//priorities . last time eaten.
